# A Restaurant Recommendation Tool with GUI

This was a location-based group assignment. The task was to survey local restaurants in Seoul and gather data to implement a restaurant recommendation system using logical rules.


The GUI was built with Python Tkinter. User inputs are collected, converted and passed onto a Prolog query system through PySWIP.
